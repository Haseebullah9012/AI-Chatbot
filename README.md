## Getting Started

This is a General Purpose Chat Bot. 

It uses Google's Gemini General Model.

## Some Features
 - Specific System Instructions are given, and the model is configured for our use case. 

 - It streams the Response Messages, and they get rendered as soon as they become available. THis enhances User Experience. 

 - The Words are typed with Typewriter Effect Animcation. Looks Cool. 

 - The Markdown Feature is also applied to the Respones. Which makes the Responses much more better and Easier to Read. 

 - The Model remembers the whole Context, from the beginning of Conversation. 

 - The Input Textarea is Multi-line. Press Shift-Enter to get to the new Line. And Press Enter to Send Message. 

 - Auto Scrolling with the COntent. 

 - Dark Clean UI with appropriate Margins and Paddings. Still isn't Perfect for Mobile Screens. 


 ## Things we could do for Further Improvement. 
  - Make Model work with and Analyze Image, Audio, Video Files. 

  - Add Multi-Language Support. 

  - Add User-Authentication, and Store the whole Session. And even Create Multiple Sessions. 

  - User Feedback Mechanism for Model's Improvement

  - Implement RAG to have access to large Corpus of Data. It will increase Model's Accuracy. 

  - Implement multiple Models, and ROuter Model to pick which model is best suited for the given Prompt.
